OSM Buildings is a JavaScript library for visualizing 3D OSM building data on interactive maps.

The library consists of client JavaScript files, an optional server side PHP script and a MySQL / PostGIS databases.
Everything should be seen as alpha state, all components are likely to change extensively.

Bottleneck at the moment is data availability. I can't process and host a whole OSM planet file.
